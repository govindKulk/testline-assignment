Hello,  

I have completed the assignment, and I truly enjoyed working on it! Due to my semester exams, I couldn't add more features, but I made sure to implement key functionalities that enhance the user experience and scalability.  

Here are some of the features I implemented:  

- **Rich Text in Explanations**: Used React Markdown to format and display explanations in a clean and readable manner.  
- **Gamification with Sounds**: Integrated audio feedback (success, wrong, and completion sounds) to make the quiz engaging.  
- **Smooth Animations with Framer Motion**: Implemented smooth transitions for navigating between questions and displaying results.  
- **Real-World API Call Simulation**: Added artificial delays to mimic real API behavior for better UX testing.  
- **Scalable Code & Folder Structure**: Separated concerns into dedicated files (types, server actions, components) for maintainability.  
- **Server Actions for API Calls**: Leveraged Next.js server actions to handle API interactions efficiently.  
- **ShadCN & Tailwind for UI**: Used ShadCN components with Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing and consistent design.  
- **Results Screen with Filters**: Implemented filtering options on the results page to analyze performance better.  
- **Instant Feedback on Selection**: Provided immediate visual feedback upon answer selection (correct/incorrect state).  
- **Submission Confirmation Dialog**: Added a final confirmation prompt before submitting the quiz to prevent accidental submissions.  

I really appreciate the opportunity to work on this, and I’m very interested in contributing to Testline. The platform looks exciting, and I’d love to be a part of it!  

Looking forward to your feedback.  

Best regards,  
Govind Kulkarni

## Local Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
